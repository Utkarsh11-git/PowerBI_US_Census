### Introduction:
The report sheds light on the US Adult Census income data with respect to various social factors such as Age, Education, Gender, etc. for the USA, Canada, Mexico, Germany, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico. These elements reveal information about how they affect revenue levels in various fields. The report performs the analysis for the same using the income data.

### Objective
The objective of creating the dashboard is to compare multiple variables available in the dataset to find outliers, anomalies, and important insights. The dataset will provide us with useful information such as average hours worked per week, the total number of people employed in a sector, the percentage of men and women in an occupation, etc. This will help the decision-makers make better choices in order to aid people who are in need. I have used Power BI for this project because it has a more user-friendly and intuitive interface, with drag-and-drop functionality and easier-to-use visuals.

### Dataset Description:
* **Age**: Ranging from 17 to 90.
* **Workclass**: Various sectors such as Private, Government, and Self.
* **Education**: Education background such as 12th, Graduate, High School, etc.
* **Occupation**: Sales, Crafts, Admin, etc.
* **Relationship**: Husband, Wife, etc.
* **Gender**: Male, Female.
* **Hours-per-week**: Average no of hours of work per week.
* **Country**: Country of origin, such as Canada, United States, etc.
* **Income**: Divided by under or equal to 50K or over 50K.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the data using various charts and DAX measures, we can conclude that:
* The majority of the population, both men and women, earns less than 50k per year.
* Around 75% of those who earn 50k and above are ‘Husbands’.
* The average number of hours worked per week is highest among self-employed people and lowest among those who are unpaid.
* The private sector is the highest contributor to the working class across all genders.
* Most of the people are high school graduates.
